Why we don't use our local/personal laptops/computers to host websites and testing frameworks?
    1) I have to keep my laptop up and running all the time.
    2) Personal laptops/Computers don't have enough RAM CPU power to entertain huge requests
    3) Internet connections aer not that good
    4) Security is also a very big problem when it comes to host services on local machine.
    For these reasons we use servers
    5) Everyone can easily access them through their personal laptops
    =====================================================
    SDLC:
    1) BAs discuss the requirements with clients and develop the SRS documents
    2) This document is then shared with Architects and QA team leads
    3) Architects design the software requirement documents(SRD) and QA leads start
    planning the testing.
    4) Once the SRD are ready developers start working(coding) and start building the
    application.
    5) This is where the deployment life cycle starts
        1) Once the application us developed on local/personal computers by developers they ask other developers
        or architects to review their code for any type of mistake they and after that they push the code to
        the git or any other version control system once it is done
        they request the dev ops or IT Teams to deploy the application to the development server(Dev) so
        that they are sure application still works outside their laptops.
        2) QA will request Dev ops IT team to deploy it to QA server
        3) If everything looks good all the test cases are passed QAs will deploy it to Staging server
        staging servers they aer replica of production servers sd that we can test the application in as possible
        as same environment as production and after that to production server.
        4) if test cases fail QA will report them to Developer and whole cycle starts again
